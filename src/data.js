        description: "I went on a trip to South Korea to attend a friend's wedding. The wedding was held in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. I had always wanted to visit South Korea because of its rich culture and history, so I was excited to explore the city. During my stay in Seoul, I visited several popular tourist attractions, including Gyeongbokgung Palace, Namsan Tower, and Myeong-dong shopping district. I also tried traditional Korean cuisine, such as kimchi, bulgogi, and bibimbap, which were all delicious. After the wedding, I decided to extend my trip and visit Hong Kong and Macau as well. In Hong Kong, I explored the city's famous landmarks, such as Victoria Peak and the Big Buddha. I also tried some of the local street food, such as egg tarts and fish balls, which were both tasty and affordable. In Macau, I visited the famous casinos and enjoyed the city's Portuguese-style architecture. I also tried the famous Portuguese egg tarts, which were some of the best I've ever had.",

It was great to catch up with my old friends and reminisce about our college days. Another highlight of the trip was meeting new friends who I'm still close with today. During my trip, I visited Tokyo and Kyoto. In Tokyo, I explored the vibrant neighborhoods of Shibuya and Shinjuku, and took in the breathtaking views from the Tokyo Skytree. In Kyoto, I visited several stunning temples and shrines, including Kiyomizu-dera and Fushimi Inari-taisha.",
